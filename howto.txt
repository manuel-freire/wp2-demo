There are 3 apps

- The API (SDAa)
  http://localhost:3000/api
  (npm: test-users)
  
- The tracking server (SISA)
  http://localhost:3350/signup
  (npm: gf)
  
- The emotions server
  [to be completed]

===

- We are first going to set up things in the AAPI:

  + register
    http://localhost:3000/login
    root 
    root

  + add the apps
    add the gleaner back-end (SISA, T2.1b)
    (use App1 in Text-Area mode)
    http://localhost:3000/applications

- Now we want to have some users; we will register
  them via SISA - but they will be role-less until
  SDA intervenes

    + a developer,
    + a teacher
    + a student

    (* must logout+login to refresh auth!)

    + so we register via

    http://localhost:3350/signup

- So we give them some roles
  (The roles were created when registering the apps)
  
  http://localhost:3000/applications
  + dev is developer
  + stu is student
  + tea is teacher
  
- The developer logs in to register a new game

    http://localhost:3350/login
    
    When created, the new game is assigned a trackingcode
    It must be sent when tracking
    
    In our particular case, we expect a 
    track.txt file with the following format
    nano /opt/gf/app/public/lostinspace/assets/track.txt

- The developer chooses traces to send, what 
  teachers will see the traces
  (realtime analytics model)
  
  + sets the link
  
  (* use actual public IP here!)
    http://localhost:3350/lostinspace/index.html
  
  + sets session information
  
    Alias=this.var.username ? this.var.username : this.var.nickname
    Score=this.var.score
    Max Score=10000
    Progress=this.var.phase / 13

  + warnings and alerts are conditions

    this.var.inactivity > 60
    this.var.xml_invalid /Maximum difference/ 5

- this is different for another game, "inboxed"
  
    this.var['name']
    this.var['_score']
    20000
    (this.zone.startsWith('day') ? parseInt(this.zone.substring(3)) : 0) / 5

    In Splash Screen Condition:
    this.zone === "splash"
    
- now, on the AA API, we set up the experiment
  as Teacher
  
  + log out and in (tea/tea)
  + pick game
  
    o lostinspace
    (* may have to reload page to avoid storm errors)
    + launch storm topology
    + add stu as student
    
    o inboxed
    (* may have to reload page to avoid storm errors)
    + launch storm topology
    + add stu as student
    
- now, on the CITA, stu logs in...

  + (* may have to press enter on url for redirect to catch)
